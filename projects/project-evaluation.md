# Project Evaluation â€“ Comparing Unit 6 and Unit 11 Projects

This section evaluates the transition from the **Unit 6 team project** (*Airbnb Price Prediction and Market Segmentation in New York City*) to the **Unit 11 individual project** (*Object Recognition with CNNs*).  
It examines differences in objectives, scope, modelling approach, teamwork, and personal development.

## 1. Project Focus and Objectives

| Aspect | Unit 6 â€“ Team Project | Unit 11 â€“ Individual Project |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Topic** | Predicting Airbnb prices and clustering listings in NYC | Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks |
| **Goal** | Identify price drivers and market segments to inform Airbnb strategy | Compare custom CNN and VGG16 transfer-learning models on CIFAR-10 |
| **Problem Type** | Structured tabular data; regression + clustering | Unstructured visual data; supervised image classification |
| **Outcome** | Quantitative and business insights for pricing strategy | Technical performance comparison and reflection on deep-learning practice |

The Unit 6 project emphasised **collaborative application of classical ML**, while Unit 11 extended this into **independent deep-learning research**, showing clear progression in technical depth and autonomy.

## 2. Modelling Approach and Learning Progression

In Unit 6, our workflow used **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **K-Means Clustering**.  
I implemented the Random Forest, supported the clustering analysis, and produced key visualisations.  
These methods focused on **interpretability and market insight**, reinforcing my understanding of feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and the trade-off between transparency and accuracy.

By contrast, Unit 11 demanded **end-to-end model design and training** on high-dimensional data.  
Building CNNs and applying transfer learning deepened my knowledge of **representation learning, overfitting control (dropout, early stopping)**, and **performance diagnostics**.  
The experience moved me from feature-based modelling to automated feature extraction â€” a conceptual leap that clarified how data structure shapes model choice.

## 3. Collaboration vs. Independence

| Dimension | Unit 6 â€“ Team Collaboration | Unit 11 â€“ Individual Work |
|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Environment** | Virtual team of four using Teams and shared docs | Fully independent research project |
| **My Role** | Led Random Forest analysis, assisted with clustering, wrote intro/conclusion, created visuals, coordinated final draft | Sole author: handled all data prep, model design, training, evaluation, and presentation |
| **Challenges** | Balancing workload; ensuring equal participation | Managing time and scope; deciding when to stop training and start documenting |
| **Learning** | Leadership, communication, and delegation | Self-management, technical independence, and deeper critical reflection |

The shift from shared decision-making to personal accountability highlighted my growth in **project ownership and research discipline**.

---

## 4. Technical and Critical Development

Between the two projects I progressed from:
- Understanding **ensemble and clustering techniques** to implementing **deep architectures**.
- Reporting results descriptively to **critiquing model behaviour** (bias, generalisation, ethical implications).
- Relying on team review to **self-validating** results through metrics, visualisations, and reflection.

Feedback from Unit 6 (requesting more critical depth) directly informed Unit 11, where I expanded my analysis of training curves, confusion matrices, and performance trade-offs, addressing that earlier gap.

## 5. Professional and Personal Impact

Both projects developed complementary skills:
- **Technical:** from feature-based ML to convolutional and transfer-learning pipelines.
- **Analytical:** stronger ability to interpret metrics beyond accuracy.
- **Professional:** improved planning, documentation, and ethical awareness.
- **Personal:** recognition of leadership tendencies and the need for workload balance â€” insight drawn from the peer-evaluation exercise.

These outcomes have strengthened my confidence in applying machine-learning methods to real-world problems and reinforced the importance of **reflective, ethical practice** in professional AI work.

## 6. Summary of Key Learning

| Area | Growth Achieved |
|------|-----------------|
| **Technical depth** | Advanced from regression and ensembles to CNNs and transfer learning |
| **Critical thinking** | Greater evaluation of model limitations and ethical context |
| **Collaboration** | Practised leadership and coordination in a distributed team |
| **Independence** | Managed full research cycle individually |
| **Communication** | Enhanced ability to present complex technical findings clearly |

---

### Conclusion

Evaluating these two projects side by side demonstrates a clear trajectory, from applying existing algorithms collaboratively to designing and evaluating advanced models independently.  
The Unit 6 team experience laid the groundwork in data handling, analysis, and teamwork, and the Unit 11 project consolidated that foundation, extending it into deep-learning.
Together they mark a meaningful progression in both **technical competence** and **professional maturity**.
