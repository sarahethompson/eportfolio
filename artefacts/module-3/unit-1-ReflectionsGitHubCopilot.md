## Reflection on ‘Think Python’

Working through *Think Python* (Downey, 2015) gave me an opportunity to revisit the fundamentals of programming through a structured and gradual learning approach. Although I already use Python occasionally in my job, revisiting the basics helped reinforce my understanding of core concepts such as classes, inheritance and types like dictionaries. I particularly appreciated the book’s step-by-step progression and its focus on building problem-solving skills incrementally, through short exercises that introduced topics like recursion and object-oriented thinking in a very approachable way.

I tried one of the exercises (on inheritance) to test my understanding and explore how a chatbot like ChatGPT could support learning (OpenAI, 2025). The interactive nature, combining explanatory text with opportunities to write and run code immediately, helped to consolidate concepts that I typically take for granted. It reminded me of the value of slowing down and reflecting on *why* certain constructs work the way they do, rather than just *how* to implement them.
