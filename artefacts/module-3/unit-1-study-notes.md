# Unit 1 Study Notes – Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning (ML) automates automation — computers program themselves from data.
- Core idea: “Let the data do the work.”
- 60-year-old field enabled today by IoT and social media data.
- ML drives the Fourth Industrial Revolution — machines make decisions in many sectors.
- Algorithms now influence behaviour, creativity, and human decision-making.

## 2. Classifying Spam Email
- Spam detection is a key ML use case in digital security.
- Goal: separate spam (“junk”) from regular (“ham”) emails.
- Steps:
  1. Analyse existing emails to identify spam features.
  2. Label examples as spam or not spam.
  3. Train the model on labelled data.
  4. Test model performance.
  5. Optimise for accuracy.
  6. Deploy to classify incoming mail.
- Demonstrates supervised learning (learning from labelled examples).

## 3. Displacing Human Drivers with Self-Drive Cars
- Self-driving cars use **AI, ML, and IoT** to replace human drivers.
- IoT connects sensors and systems to share data.
- ML algorithms enable:
  - **Object detection** (identifying people, cars, obstacles).
  - **Object classification** (understanding what they are).
  - **Decision-making** (navigating traffic safely).
- Example of ML simulating perception and control like humans.

## 4. Big Data and Future Society
- Big data growth has accelerated exponentially in the past two decades.
- Tech companies use massive datasets for insights and commercial gain.
- Our **digital footprint** defines identity and personality online.
- ML can infer traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism).
- Regulation often lags behind digital innovation, creating ethical and privacy risks.
- Big data fuels ML; ML drives AI — shaping how society and individuals are understood.
