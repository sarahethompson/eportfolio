title: Unit 7 Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks
order: 6
summary: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a biology inspired algorithm that, like animal brain, can learn from the environment and adapt itself to make more correct decisions. At present, ANN and its variant algorithm is used widely in different areas of our lives, from marketing to automation. ANN is a key driver for the industry 4.0 revolution, where machines are making decisions with minimal or no human interactions.
