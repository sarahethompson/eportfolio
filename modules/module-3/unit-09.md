[← Back to Module 3](./)

## Summary
Deep learning has revolutionised artificial intelligence by enabling highly complex pattern recognition across different domains, from image processing to natural language understanding. This week, we will build upon traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and explore more advanced architectures.

## Key topics
- The algorithm underpinning CNN in detail.
- CNN specific python libraries and examples.
- Applications of CNN in real life.
