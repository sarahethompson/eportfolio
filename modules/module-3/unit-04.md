## Key topics
- How to use Scikit-Learn to model a linear relationship.
- How to develop a multivariate linear regression model.
- How to evaluate the effectiveness of your model.

## Notes
**Correlation and Regression**

Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. It tells us how closely the points on a scatter plot cluster around a straight line and whether that line goes up or down.

Regression, specifically linear regression, is about finding a linear model (a straight line) that best describes the relationship between a dependent variable (like CO2 emissions) and one or more independent variables (like engine size or fuel consumption). Once you have this model, you can use it to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable(s).

So, correlation helps us understand if a linear relationship exists and how strong it is, while regression helps us build a model to use that linear relationship for prediction. Correlation is often a good first step before performing a linear regression to see if a linear model is appropriate.
