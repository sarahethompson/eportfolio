title: Module 3 — Machine Learning
---

[← Back to Home](/eportfolio/)

## Overview
An introduction to machine learning through practical, hands-on case studies using real-world data.  
This module explored supervised and unsupervised algorithms, model evaluation, and ethical considerations in applying ML to realistic problems.

## Learning Outcomes
- Explain and apply core paradigms and algorithms in machine learning.
- Conduct data analysis using Python or R.
- Evaluate the applicability and challenges of ML techniques with real datasets.
- Synthesise information to analyse complex data-driven problems.
- Reflect on the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by ML practitioners.

## Project Work and Reflections
Throughout this module, I developed both technical and critical understanding of machine learning by applying theory to progressively more complex projects.  
The team-based Unit 6 project focused on structured data and traditional ML algorithms for price prediction and clustering, while the individual Unit 11 project explored image recognition using deep learning and transfer learning.  
Together, these projects demonstrate my growth from collaborative model implementation to independent design, evaluation, and reflection on advanced AI techniques.
