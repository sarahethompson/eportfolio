title: Unit 8 Training an Artificial Neural Network
order: 7

[← Back to Module 3](./)

## Summary
Last week, we learned about the structure of human neuron and how that influenced the development of artificial neural network (ANN), its structure and how it works. We will continue with the example of ANN discussed last week.

## Key topics
- How the network learns from its mistake or error.
- How backpropagation helps to adjust the neuron connection weights.
- The application of ANN in real life scenarios.
