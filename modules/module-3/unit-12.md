## Summary
The so-called “smartization” of industries, often referred to as Industry 4.0, represents a paradigm shift driven by artificial intelligence, automation, and machine learning. With the rapid advancement of AI and ML, we are moving towards a world where self-learning systems, efficient AI architectures, and edge computing are becoming the backbone of modern technological ecosystems. Machine learning is evolving beyond traditional supervised learning, with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) unlocking AI’s ability to learn from unlabelled data, Edge AI enabling real-time decision-making on low-power devices, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automating deep learning model design. These future trends are shaping the next era of AI-powered solutions across healthcare, finance, autonomous systems, and smart cities. This week, we will explore these cutting-edge trends in machine learning and their impact on Industry 4.0 applications.

## Key topics
- Industry 4.0 revolution and growth of machine derived data.
- How machine learning algorithms are deployed in this industry 4.0 environment.
- The concept of digital twins and its relationship with data science.
- Jobs prospects in industry 4.0 era.
- The emergence of Industry 5.0.
